## 📝 Description

📌 Problem Statement: Stock Market Analysis & Forecasting Application (Streamlit)
Financial markets generate massive volumes of time-dependent data, making it challenging for investors, analysts, and decision-makers to interpret market trends and predict future stock movements. Traditional dashboards often provide only basic visualizations without advanced forecasting capabilities, limiting their usefulness for data-driven investment decisions.
To address this, the objective of this project is to develop an interactive Streamlit-based Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting Application that enables users to:
1️⃣ Analyze Historical Stock Data
Fetch real-time and historical market data for any user-selected stock.
Display line charts, candlestick charts, moving averages, and technical indicators.
Offer intuitive filtering by date ranges, indicators, and visualization type.
2️⃣ Perform Multi-Model Time Series Forecasting
Integrate multiple forecasting algorithms to predict future stock prices, including:
ARIMA
SARIMA
Prophet
LSTM Neural Network
Users should be able to compare model performance, view forecast plots, and analyze evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, etc.
3️⃣ Provide Interactive Model Comparison and Insights
Compare forecasts from all models in a unified view.
Generate downloadable reports summarizing the analysis.
Offer explanation and transparency through residual plots and error metrics.
4️⃣ Deliver a Real-Time, User-Friendly UI
Build the entire interface using Streamlit with a clean, professional layout.
Enable user inputs such as ticker symbol, date range, and model selection.
Offer fast computations and visually appealing charts optimized for user experience.
🎯 Project Goal
To create a complete stock market intelligence system that combines market analysis, technical indicators, and advanced forecasting models into a single, easy-to-use Streamlit application for investors, analysts, and financial researchers.
